        <li>Cooking oil for frying</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Shrimp Floss: (you can substitute with store-bought meat floss too)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup dried shrimp soaked in warm water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Other toppings:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup roasted peanuts</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds</li>
        <li>2-3 red/green Thai chili finely chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Making garlic chips:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat about 1 inch of oil in a medium size pan. When the oil is hot, lower the heat to medium and add the
            slices of garlic. Watch it closely and if the garlic browns too quickly, remove from the heat. Place the
            fried garlic on an absorbent paper towel and store in a air-tight container</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Making dried yellow split peas:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Drain off the soaking water and pat them really dry with absorbent paper towel. Preheat about 2 inches of
            oil in a medium size pan. When the oil is hot enough, add the split peas. They will bubble. Lower the heat
            to medium and fry until they are slightly golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove the peas to absorbent paper
            towel. Season with some salt and store in a air-tight container</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Making the shrimp floss:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the dried shrimp in warm water for about 15 minutes. Drain off water, pat them dry and put in a food
            processor and process into a powder/floss like texture. Preheat a small to medium size pan on medium heat
            and stir fry the shrimp floss on the dry pan until fragrant and dry, about 15-20 minutes. Remove from the
            heat and store in the jar in the refrigerator for a month or so</li>
        <li>You can also ready-made pork floss from the store</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assembling the salad:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>This salad is typically served on a platter with sections to put in all the ingredients separately. I just
            serve everything in one bowl. Place the cabbage and the rest of the ingredients in a large salad bowl. Mix
            everything to make sure the veggies are coated with dressing. Topped with garlic chips, fried yellow split
            peas, shrimp floss, and the rest of the toppings. Give it a final toss and serve</li>
    </ol>
